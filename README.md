## Adaptive-Signal-Timer - Intellisignal

#### Traffic density in urban cities varies immensely depending on the time of the day. But the signal timer is fixed irrespective of the time. Sometimes there may be less vehicles at the signal resulting in wastage of seconds after lane gets empty. Due to this traffic may get accumulated on another signals. We used Yolov8 object detection algorithm to detect number of vehicles in the lane using CCTVs at the signal and deduce the timer for the signal based on the algorithm that we developed.
